# Abstract

We derive sharp upper and lower bounds for the pointwise concentration function
of the maximum statistic of $d$ identically distributed real-valued random
variables. Our first main result places no restrictions either on the common
marginal law of the samples or on the copula describing their joint
distribution. We show that, in general, strictly sublinear dependence of the
concentration function on the dimension $d$ is not possible. We then introduce
a new class of copulas, namely those with a convex diagonal section, and
demonstrate that restricting to this class yields a sharper upper bound on the
concentration function. This allows us to establish several new
dimension-independent and poly-logarithmic-in-$d$ anti-concentration
inequalities for a variety of marginal distributions under mild dependence
assumptions. Our theory improves upon the best known results in certain special
cases. Applications to high-dimensional statistical inference are presented,
including a specific example pertaining to Gaussian mixture approximations for
factor models, for which our main results lead to superior distributional
guarantees.
