# Abstract

Clinical risk prediction models are regularly updated as new data, often with
additional covariates, become available. We propose CARE (Convex Aggregation of
relative Risk Estimators) as a general approach for combining existing
"external" estimators with a new data set in a time-to-event survival analysis
setting. Our method initially employs the new data to fit a flexible family of
reproducing kernel estimators via penalised partial likelihood maximisation.
The final relative risk estimator is then constructed as a convex combination
of the kernel and external estimators, with the convex combination coefficients
and regularisation parameters selected using cross-validation. We establish
high-probability bounds for the $L_2$-error of our proposed aggregated
estimator, showing that it achieves a rate of convergence that is at least as
good as both the optimal kernel estimator and the best external model.
Empirical results from simulation studies align with the theoretical results,
and we illustrate the improvements our methods provide for cardiovascular
disease risk modelling. Our methodology is implemented in the Python package
[care-survival](https://github.com/WGUNDERWOOD/care-survival).
